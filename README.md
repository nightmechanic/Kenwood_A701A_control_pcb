Kenwood_A701A_control_pcb
=========================

This is a Control PCB for a Kenwood A701A kitchen mixer.

Created for our kitchen mixer restoration project.

Benefits:
  - Allows using a common 470 ohm 25W cement resistor (+ a 2W 10kohm ) instead of the expensive DR type resistor originaly used by Kenwood.
  - Uses terminal blocks for wire connections
  - the components are mounted on the PCB instead of floating around...
